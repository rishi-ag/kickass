As it stands we see no issue here but there is a small possibility that our funding (which is limited) may be cut short and our ability to maintain access to Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud may disappear. Currently we have enough funding to maintain access to the Creative Cloud tools through the end of the calendar year. See as how we plan to have the project finished by then, the loss of the development tools is only a possibility (and an extremely small one at that).

We have drafted a couple ideas for our music video and I guess in this department since we will be collaborating with film students that could take a little longer, but we will only move on to this once we have recorded the album.", 
            "Although we are very organised and have everything scheduled in for the next 6 months it is quite common in the music industry for there to be delays especially when working with so many people and considering how driven we are to never settle for anything less than astonishing. Whatever happens you will always be kept in the loop and our album will be released no matter what!"

As far as the musical content goes, most of the instrumentals have already been completed, the story has been written and so have my verses.

I have done some of these sketches on the plane en route to some city in the US for a work trip and I write some of my songs in the hotel at night after I leave the office. Now since I am doing all of the comic drawing myself, I set a pretty realistic delivery date to ensure I don\u2019t tick anyone off by being late.

We have secured funding from the Regional Art and Culture Council,  Oregon Community Foundation, Northwest Health Foundation and Oregon Jewish Community Youth Foundation.  Our show will go on even if we don't accomplish our Kickstarter.  However, it will mean a big difference for us. We will not be able to get all the costumes we need, we will not be able to hire a professional videographer nor a photographer to document our performance.  We also need funding to hire ASL interpreters and an Audio Describer to make our performance accessible for everyone!"

The worst that could happen is an unforeseen issue with our current choice of printer, but we have chosen two excellent backups just in case so production should not be sufficiently delayed in the event of disaster.", 
            "Ebook edition: Without the concern of printing a physical edition, there is virtually no risk with the ebook version.  As above, the book itself is already been written, it just needs to finish the editing process and be formatted into your favorite ebook format.", 
            "Book 2:  Some of the reward tiers include the second book of the series.  This gamebook is approximately 50% completed.  The tentative release window is late summer for book 2. This release window has been chosen judiciously, with knowledge of writing speed and leaving time for editing and formatting."

",

We will also get all the necessary information from the legal team with our professional organization in order to create clarity and limit this project to within a legal and ethical scope. In our community meeting prior to the event listeners will collaborate to trouble shoot these particular challenges and possible scenarios. ",

            "- LOCATION: The largest chunk of the budget will go towards paying for a location. The story takes place in a specific business located in an ethnic neighborhood. The character Sheila is forced to ask for help in a public place. We are looking to pay business owners, who will have to close their store for two days for us to shoot in their shops. We also have to pay someone from the store to supervise on set due to production safety requirements. ", 
            "- ART DIRECTION: To elevate the film\u2019s look, the location has an old-school aesthetic design to it. The shop is owned by a Russian immigrant. We will be buying and making Russian language posters for the store and its bathroom. Other props and costumes we will need include pastries to fill the shop, kitchen utensils, aprons, and black work pants. A visual motif in the story is the color red. So we will be buying red props such as red napkins and flowers. Because the story revolves around Sheila\u2019s stained shorts, my art team will buy several pairs of white shorts to test out the bloodstain. We will need to buy red dye and fake blood.  ", 
            "- TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT: Due to the large amount of camera equipment, lighting rigs, tripods, and electrical gear, we will rent a U-Haul truck for two full days to transport the equipment to set. We will be hiring drivers and renting a passenger van to drive the cast and crew to the location set as well.  ", 
            "- CAMERA EQUIPMENT: To achieve the desired comedy look, we will be renting a zoom lens, filters, and follow focus. Other smaller accessories include extra batteries, lighting meter, and disk drives.  ", 
            "- FOOD: Buying three full days of meals during the film shoot for all fifteen members of my cast and crew. My actors and crew members are all working for free on the project. The least I can do is offer them healthy meals, not carb loaded fast food, to stay energized on set.  ", 
            "Thank you for taking the time to read about this project. I am grateful for all the hardworking and passionate people who are supporting this movie. We would greatly appreciate any of your help! You are all helping to make this project become the best film that it can be! ",

I want to exceed expectations on this front once again like we did on our first three Kickstarter projects. So to once again help support this goal, we have already completed sculpting and initial master molding on the core set of miniatures. We have also performed test castings to ensure everything is dialed in from a pewter quality perspective. We have already had our pewter miniature caster set aside casting time and packing time so we can quickly get a head start on production as this campaign is underway. Just like with our first three Kickstarter projects, we will keep our backers in the loop with frequent updates throughout the run of this new Kickstarter project. All of our production and packing/shipping will take place in/from the Midwest USA.",

We are in our 13th year of business and have shipped orders out all over the world in the past 13+ years. We also completed and fully delivered on our first three Kickstarter projects. International shipping is expensive and this large release will be no exception. Dark Sword Miniatures has built a reputation of top notch quality and dependability over the years in regards to both our miniatures and our shipping turn times. And we aim to build upon that reputation once again with this new Kickstarter.",

But at the same time, overcoming those challenges is one of the most satisfying rewards life has to offer, which is why the film will most certainly get made if this Kickstarter is successful!",

Together with my wife and business partner Jennifer, we have over 54 years of combined experience in creating and implementing hundreds of creative projects for our commercial clients at Brickhouse Studios Inc, many much larger and more complex than this book project. We have outlined the project so that it\u2019s fully manageable with no major unknowns.

On her debut EP, Words Like Yours, her songs will sound familiar to fans of American roots music, but are tinged with Old World accents and surprising melismas and ornaments.  That\u2019s because she lays claim to more influences than most roots musicians today.\nShe was initially inspired by Celtic music, especially Irish fiddling and the highly-rhythmic Cape Breton fiddle style, eventually making her way to Old Time string band music and other Americana influences.  While in Boston, where she was attending the New England Conservatory, Henley tapped the local scene to connect with a younger generation of songwriters and instrumentalists, and has continued to work with top-flight young traditionalists like Rushad Eggleston, Brittany & Natalie Haas, and Tashina & Tristan Clarridge.  However, it was her move to Tel Aviv, Israel for three years that cemented her current work.  There Henley became inspired by the language and rhythms of Sephardic culture, music that she had first experienced as a young child. The flowing and bubbling vocal lines of Ladino music and language seeped into her own songwriting and brought a new repertoire. Never losing sight of her original interests in Celtic and American roots music, her new sound could be called Old World Americana. "

One listen to the Houston native's ethereal purr is enough to hook even the most casual music fan, and her song \"Lucky\" was featured on the MTV series United States of Tara. It was Edmonson's mother's record collection and old movies that initially stirred her artistic soul, but having a career in music wasn't initially a given. After a stint at college in Charleston, South Carolina, Edmonson returned to Texas and decided to follow the musical call. An audition for American Idol in 2002 landed Edmonson a trip to Hollywood and a spot in the Top 48. Her Idol dreams ended abruptly when judge Randy Jackson told the singer she didn't \"look like a star.\" After her exit from Idol, Edmonson began honing her chops at open-mike nights and eventually made the transition to full-time performer. Her debut album, 2009's Take to the Sky, was a mix of classic and modern songs, and proved Edmonson was more than ready for her jazz ascension. Three years later, she returned with the Kickstarter-funded Way Down Low. In 2014, Edmonson released the Mitchell Froom-produced The Big Picture. "

For the past three years, I have taken most of this work on with support from the already over stretched staff of The Amala Foundation.  We all see the impact of this program, so we do as much as we can to keep it running.  During the programs themselves there is an extraordinary vigor among our extended community and everyone can see, taste and feel what is happening.  However, once the week is over and there is much follow up work to be done, we feel the toll of \"volunteering\".  ",

Also, it is our hope that by staffing this role, we will also be able to grow further in our ability to spread our music to the world."

            "Right now, the biggest challenge is creating that fear, tension, and anxiety that we all feel when we watch a thriller or horror film.  The director and cinematographer have put a lot of time into designing a shot-list that we feel will emanate the fear of the leading character, Carolina.  This isn't a \"typical coverage\" type of movie.  Every shot, every camera movement, and lens have been specifically designed to immerse the audience into the tale of La Llorona.  We plan to play with shadows as visual representations, which the production designer and cinematographer are designing and testing ahead of time.  Because this is a student film, the post production should stay on schedule because of our deadline.  We're also shooting earlier than most of the other projects, giving our editor and sound designer more time than usual for student advanced productions."

My approach is already almost entirely different; more organized and more direct. I know what I want. I've been fantasizing about this for years! I have incredible people on board to play on the album, engineer the album and help me make this into something worth sharing.\nThe timing of an album is always hard. You want time to devote your best attention and energy to every step of the process. Funding, recording, mixing, mastering, printing, promoting, distributing... you speed up the process and things will get lost in the mix, you slow it down too much and everyone will forget you were even working on an album. The reality is that you want to make sure you're doing it right the first time. So, I'm hoping it will take me just a little over a year to get on with this project. I'm hoping. You're my inspiration, though, and I am tirelessly devoted to this and to those who are making it possible. With your assistance, I won't be delayed by the financial difficulties. Together this album will be the best that it can be."

The funding from this Kickstarter will allow us to hire the much-needed help to get the service completed but we are always balancing our day jobs with the volunteer work for Autism Village. We don\u2019t expect this risk to result in anything more than potential delays \u2013 and it\u2019s our goal to complete the software early \u2013 but it\u2019s a risk so we\u2019re noting it here.",

            "Hosting of this app will be in a cloud based service. This will have an ongoing cost and Autism Village does not yet have sufficient track record as a company, non-profit or otherwise (our non-profit filing is in process), to ensure that we\u2019ll be able to fund the hosting on an ongoing basis. As a result, we could run into issues with contracts with the cloud hosting provider accepting us as a customer. Of course, if we overachieve in our fundraising here on Kickstarter, we can prepay months or years of hosting. Various project founders might also be willing to co-sign for this hosting.",

This is always the case in any software/system project but we\u2019ve lots of experience in this and we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll get through it if it pops it\u2019s ugly head up.",

We are planning for good word of mouth and word spreading through the social networks on Facebook, Twitter, etc. to achieve this. We have not planned on much use of funds for promotion. If we\u2019ve underestimated the cost and effort to get the word out, and we don\u2019t overachieve our funding goal to make up for this, we could have a released app with too few users to be useful. If this becomes the case count on us to make every personal effort to get the word out and to raise more funds to help."

For instance, in 2013-2014, our first season after losing our founding co-director due to illness, we rebounded and increased the number of new works in production, toured a children's show to 20 public schools, doubled our budget, launched our fundraising infrastructure and started an outreach program that provides two weekly modern dance classes free of charge. We have self-produced three evening length works, hosted three works in progress showings and delivered two commissioned works for Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Greater than 50% of our events have been offered free to the public and more than half were produced as cross-disciplinary collaborations. The quality and quantity of our outreach in the community is unparalleled for an organization of our size.",

Ari has the professional experience of providing guidance to teaching artists and teachers in finding authentic connections, lesson plan writing and Best Practices in arts education. She holds degrees in Elementary Education and Humanities and has 10 plus years of teaching experience in school and studio environments including: Teacher Professional Developments, Teaching Artist PD\u2019s, Master Classes and Modern Dance Technique for Harwelden Institute, Oklahoma State University's ARtS Initiative, University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Tulsa, Union, Owasso and Jenks Public School Districts. She has also been invited to speak on the creative process at Living Arts of Tulsa, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and the National Creativity Network.",

After graduation, she worked in New York City for five years as a magazine editor, freelance writer, and dance critic. Her writing about dance has appeared in such publications as Dance Insider, Dance Teacher, and the Village Voice. She was named a finalist for a 2012 Great Plains Journalism Award for her dance writing in Urban Tulsa Weekly. Alicia is a prolific photographer and creative writer, as well as a freelance editor and proofreader. Founded in 2011, Alicia's blog Tulsa Dances is the first of its kind in Tulsa, providing in-depth interviews with major choreographers and information and essays about local dance.

TuMM\u2019s artistic leadership drew its education from the BFA program of Marymount Manhattan College, the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, from Tulsa Ballet, and from decades of artistic practice.  Since our unveiling -- a site-specific piece at the Arkansas River -- we've never been content just to present work on a stage. As dancers and choreographers we draw inspiration from real bodies and emotional states, real places, real relationships -- and our work reaches back into those realities, opening up those who engage with us to new ways of looking, listening, and moving in their own lives. We are a company of strong, committed dancers. For full company bios please visit our About page at www.TuMMdance.org"

            "The challenges of creating this product have been to redesign my current RooSport 2.0 so it will comfortably and securely carry the larger phones being made today.  This has not been easy.  It has been important to keep it comfortable and also secure.  \nIf you are traveling and carrying your Passports, credit cards, etc.. I wanted to be able to design it so that it was easily concealed with light clothing.  \nIf you will use it for athletic activities like the gym or running or walking I had to redesign the magnet to be sure it was strong enough to hold on your waistband and make sure it doesn't bounce or bother you.  The results of testing:  It doesn't!  \nThe challenge for the user is to wear clothes that have a snug waist band or one they can tie.  Since you may be putting a large phone in a case in it you will have to be able to do that so that your shorts do not fall down a bit.  In my tests have shown it is awesome!  \nWe have eliminated a manufacturing risk as we have moved our factory (during our last project) to the USA!  Not having it in China makes it easier for communication and oversight during the manufacturing process.  \nI am confident that we will deliver our product on or before the stated time frame of May 2015."

I completed much work while at the cathedral, with many carvings in the public domain throughout the city and across the country.",

That's where effective publicity and marketing will come in, including newspaper ads in arts sections of Wellington papers and a radio interview with commissioned composer Mark Smythe.", 
            "The time frame for composition and rehearsal is intensive. However, Baroque Voices are already familiar with the Monteverdi, Body, Bowater & Smythe works, and Mark is committed to producing the newly-commissioned work in just one week. He recently orchestrated 22 minutes of music for 13 film cues in just 12 days, so his writing output will be up to the task. Mark will also be joining Baroque Voices in New Zealand for all rehearsals, and corresponding directly with Pepe Becker during the writing process.", 
            "The concert date has been carefully timed to avoid clashes with other significant cultural events, which is always a risk, particularly as May is New Zealand Music Month. There're also many classical performances centred around ANZAC Day (25 April), however we believe this will merely prime audiences for more."

If we surpass our minimal funding goals we should be able to build cold-frames with old windows and ply-board to extend the season and buffer the plants against erratic weather. With extra funding we can also purchase some natural soil amendments that would improve the health of our plants, making them less susceptible to disease and pests.\n\nWhy Our Project Won't Be So Risky or Challenging:",

We take risks when we incorporate beef tongue into our mostly vegan menu, and this is because we are aware of our community and want to be inclusive; meat eaters and vegans should be able to find food at the same restaurant. There is a lot we can learn from people with differing eating habits. We have an unique outlook and that's what people appreciate in us; it is why we stand out and why we will continue to grow.\nAdditionally, we are located in a food desert where there is no other place to get food within seven blocks that isn't corner store or fast food.

Such an incident might indicate on one of two options: \n(a) there are no more leopards left within this study area. \n(b) there is perhaps one last individual left in the entire study area. ",

This data is important for future conservation efforts for this endangered species.", 
            "The used method provides a census-like abundance check in which 95% of the population is expected to be encountered. That means that if the population is of one last individual we still have a chance of missing it. As far as for the study's success evaluation. If all camera-locations remained functioning for the entire 60 days then even if we got no pictures of leopards it is still considered as a successful study as it will indicate that further studies should concentrate on other regions than this.",

Nonetheless, since other people may pass in some of the locations there is a risk of theft.

I know this is my first Kickstarter project but everyone has to start somewhere right? This is my shot!. I've dreamed of an opportunity like this so I am not going to take it for granted. I am going to give it my all! One of the challenges is the commissioned artwork, I have therefore given myself enough time to complete the drawings that will be requested by the backers. All I ask for is a little patience to get you a quality product. I take great care in producing an immaculate piece for you. You will have the option to request the art book first and then I'll send the artwork once it's completed. The next risk is the printers. Please rest assured that I am using a printing service that has been used by a fellow kickstarter and is guaranteed for quality and reliability."

The creation of this film so far has called upon the contributions of professionals and students of the cinema alike, bringing together a small yet passionate community dedicated to contributing to the growth of the cinema through the expression of seldom heard independent voices.  However, the primary limitation of cinematic expression is it's reliance on funding of a larger scale than most art forms.  it is for this reason that we need your help.  Although we have completed half of the film we have unfortunately stretched our resources to their maximum, leaving us in a position in which we have chosen to call out to you; our friends and family, fellow cinephiles, and anyone interested in contributing to the work of a small group of passionate individuals.  We have all poured our hearts and souls into this work and to be able to see it fully realized is a privilege we will surely not take for granted.  Thanks for reading and see you at the movies!"

This means that when we upgrade to the 160-gallon fermentation vessels, it will take time for the culture to adapt to its new conditions and for our kombucha to achieve consistency. We will also have to learn how to work with this new equipment, as we had to when we went from our home-brew fermentation vessels to the vessels we use now. This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. To address this issue, we will continue to brew using our current 26-gallon fermentation vessels until we have mastered the new equipment and consistency is achieved in these vessels."

It has taken more than a year and so many prototypes back and forth to reach the goal of a perfect mix of elegance, comfort, waterproofness and ecofriendlyness. And price. We want to keep production local but this is not possible at the moment, mainly because sewing factories have closed down in Denmark and our neighbouring countries. And the European factories that are still there AND are ecofriendly are SO expensive (understandable) rendering the Takaokami rain gear unobtainable for most. So what to do? Well, the bigger the quantities the smaller the unit price, and that is what we are aiming for.",

Luckily I have had many experiences making records (three solo records and numerous band records) and feel confident in handling any issues that may arise.  I know how to make a realistic plan and timeline for recording, how to work with other musicians and how to get CDs into the hands of folks who appreciate the music.  Perhaps what I am most grateful for, and which makes all the difference with any up-coming challenges, are the wonderful folks I will be working with.  I have made two records with our recording engineer, the wonderful Joe DeJarnette.  Dick Harrington, Pat Egan, Ned Oldham and Tom Marshall will also be involved with this project and all are veteran musicians with plenty of recording experiences.  Plus they are all fantastic human beings.  ", 
            "The songs and tunes are well-practiced and we will be ready to record by our early May reserved studio dates.  After that, we need to mix and master the CD, work on cover graphics, get the CDs duplicated and then fulfill our promises to deliver the goods.  The December 2015 deadline is more than enough time to do all this and I expect that it will be late summer or fall when the finished project is in our hands."

The only hiccup we've encountered is with the base, the colored piece that serves as the platform for the the measuring cap to rotate within.  The bottom of the base is supposed to be flat, but its basic geometry, coupled with the properties of the material  is resulting in inconsistency of the piece when coming off of the mold. One piece might come out ok, and the next might have one level of curvature, and the next might have a different level. This is creating rotation issues as the bottom of the measuring cap is getting stuck on the curve.  ",

I didnt see all the costs coming so it took me a long time to save up the extra money to get the actual finished product in my hand.\nThis time I have done the math and gotten quotes for each of these and they all are within our goal amount.\nThe one thing that might hold this up would be a production delay on the side of the record or CD pressing companies, but I am working to book a reservation to avoid this.  Even if there is a delay it should only be a few weeks.  Just in case I rounded up on production time and set the time of release in September.  Lets hope it happens sooner!\nAs mentioned before in the project description, all 5 of the band have been working on the side for a demolition company to save $500 each for this project, we are all in.

The most challenging element will be conveying the emotion and human aspect of the script. It will be a daunting prospect to bring these emotion driven characters to life - which is why we\u2019ll need great actors. This film is set very much in the world we live in, despite the few years difference in setting. Therefore, the production design needs to be superb to bring the world to life and make it feel authentic for the actors and the audience. Finally, perhaps the most challenging aspect of this film is that it is a current issue and we need to do it justice. This is our goal and we will overcome every challenge we face to succeed."

            "In any self-run business there is always the risk of running into challenges whether it's relying on other people to come through on time or running into issues with production.  The first risk is that even we are setting our goal for $15,000, the brutal truth is that we will likely need much more than that to ensure the ability to do our first production run.  However, we have concluded that if we hit our goal and fall short of our stretch goals we are prepared to go ahead and finance with our own savings to ensure the production of Earth Encounters.  That is how dedicated we are to getting this game out into the world.  ", 
            "As for the actual production and manufacturing of the game, this is our first time doing a Kickstarter campaign so the process is fairly new to me and my father.  However, I have surrounded myself with the strongest team of successful supporters who are dedicated to helping us see this dream turn to reality.  In that, we feel confident going forward with this Kickstarter."

            "Safety is my biggest concern, especially when dealing with the epoxy coatings that are used on the surface of the foam to harden it.  The most efficient method of application is with a hopper gun.  However, this introduces epoxy to the air in a fine mist which is very dangerous if inhaled.  The best solution is to build a paint booth with filters for the incoming and outgoing air.  When using the booth I will need to wear a supplied air respirator with full face mask.\n  In addition, I must ensure that all projects are made using food safe materials where applicable.  The easiest solution is to use commercial food-grade containers and plumbing around which I build my sculptures.  This is somewhat limiting for my designs however.  The next stage of development will be to build a vacuum form table which will allow me to create liners from food grade plastic sheets in whatever shape is needed.  I am constantly researching new methods of production for all of my projects and engineering my space and processes is as much fun to me as sculpting itself."

Ideally, we would like to have them participate in the final exhibit, since we will be incorporating live performance elements in the gallery. This will all depend on several crucial factors: the availability of the students (as this is finals period) during our residency period (since Holy Week and Easter fall right in between) and our final budget. As such, for the time being, this remains a big question mark.",

            "Risks\nFrom a strategic viewpoint The Polymath is rather simple.  If we get the writers and the subscribers and we successfully monetize, it is the proverbial 'no brainer'.  However, none of the three are assured.", 
            "Writers\nThere are about 500,000 people at or above 3.3 sigma in Intellectual Sophistication and we want the fifty or so best of them.  We will not start out with them, however, our initial writing team will be good enough.  As our subscription base increases, the payment for an article will increase and we will be better able to attract the best writers.  Our asymptote on circulation of 6,000,000 translates to a payment on a 8 page article of 6,000\u00d75\u00d78\u00d740%=$96,000.  So the risk is not so much in acquiring the quality writers, but rather in the circulation and CPI assumptions.", 
            "There is a general risk concerning rate of growth in writers.  The more writers we have, the more ad producing pages and, therefore, the more budget for increasing circulation.  The larger the circulation, the more writers will earn.  If circulation growth is too low, it may prove difficult to attract and retain writers.", 
            "Circulation\nThe most important risk overall is the assumption of self financing subscriber growth.  The 30% Polymathic Institute portion from one subscriber must be sufficient to acquire more than one new subscriber.  If it is, the self financed circulation growth is divergent to market saturation.  ", 
            "The first year Polymathic Institute portion for a 64 page weekly publication at $5 CPM is $16.64.  Compared to our current 38.5\u00a2 subscriber acquisition cost, the risk appears small.  If it was not, we wouldn't be doing this crowd funding.", 
            "Monetizing\nOur closest comparable is The Economist, which charges about $80 CPM per page in its print edition.  Since we are electronic but not Internet, we consider $30 CPM to be conservative.  Generally, the display ad will be replaced with a clickable ad when the article is placed in the Archives.  There we will prefer affiliate ads over CPC but we will offer both.", 
            "In the end, though our $2-$3 CPM for a banner ad seems conservative, our CPM will be what advertisers can justify based upon results.  Blogs are typically charging $1-$2 CPM.  On the other hand Technorati reports CPMs as high as $25 for some blogs.  While Polymathicans are thought leaders who multiply awareness beyond the initial impression, in the end, $5 CPM per page (header and footer banner ads) may be too high an assumption.  That, however, while disappointing will not destroy our financial viability.  A 64 page magazine at $2 CPM per page still generates $2 per subscriber for the Polymathic Institute, still well above the cost of acquisition.  A writer will receive $6,400 per million circulation for an eight page article at $2 CPM which should attract and retain quality writers.", 
            "Conclusion\nWhile this project most certainly has risks, they are reasonable and worth taking.  In the end The Polymath simply needs to exist in the new Information Age global civilization.  At a minimum it will challenge our thought leaders and change agents to think in new directions while providing some of the inappropriately excluded with an appropriate productive outlet."

We have researched several companies that can handle this type of project and have relied heavily on the opinions of local businesses and customers.  We have narrowed the list down to the two most qualified and have gained a consensus that either group has the competency and time available to get the job done in time.  We have also budgeted an extra two weeks of time beyond what is expected to allow for the completion of the renovations, the certification from the state, and the move.  We have also been able to set aside some of the businesses funds (approximately 15% of the budget request) to act as an emergency fund in case we do go over budget due to unforeseen events.",

I will need to hire an editor to polish the text and depending on the final budget, I could add extra features It has crossed already my mind like: an unique ribbon book mark, audiobook in English and Spanish, sticker sheets, an original version of Clara\u2019s favorite red bag, etc.\n2.\tWill also need to check any additional legal considerations before this book is printed.\n3.\tDepending if I happen to meet the minimum quantity or just how many units I need to print at the end, getting the artwork ready, printing and shipping could very well take a couple months, but I\u2019m confident to be able to deliver them by September just in time for the people getting ready for the gift giving season! hoping you can impress many of your pals with this!\n4.\tFor the people that can\u2019t wait this long I will make sure to forward you the e-book as soon as is completed."

The length of time we have spent developing the work, the scale of the production, the number of \"Bellagio\" surround events planned, and the size of the audience we intend to reach, are our most ambitious goals to date.  We are an energetic and determined company, and we have always pushed ourselves to explore new paths, new mediums and new ways of relating to our audiences. It is fundamental to our creative process that we discover and then explore the appropriate means to realize a production. Even though we realized that the environment for \"Bellagio\" needed to be large-scale, active, flowing water, we were thrilled by the possibilities and got started.  We are so looking forward to bringing \"The Bellagio Fountain has been known to Make Me Cry\" to life and flooding Brooklyn with its waters."

We self-financed and published 2000 copies of \u201cJack and the Zombie Attack\u201d, we had a successful book release party with over 1000 people in attendance, we won over Barnes and Noble with our unique marketing strategies, and we overcame a 6-year Comic Con waiting list in a single attempt.",

            "We have controlled our chaotic crazy life by making many new friends to share it with.  With these strong ties, very few obstacles are foreseen, the biggest obstacle being financing the production of the book. After a failed Kickstarter event in 2012, many believed \"Jack and the Zombie Attack\" couldn't be done.  We refused to settle for defeat, and self-financed the book for $9,600.  Of the $9,600 we spent last year to produce 2000 copies of \u201cJack and the Zombie Attack\u201d, we have made our money back and that is it.", 
            "Now our obstacle is to produce 2000 copies of \u201cJack and the Pirate Attack\u201d and if we can make extra money pay to throw another release party that is a swashbuckling affair. So yes, we have set our humble goal at $4,500, but we are pushing to reach a stretch goal of $9,200 to cover the cost of the production of 2,000 books. If you didn't back us before, you have the choice now to say....I believed in them from the beginning."

            "The challenge with both of these options is that inevitably the quality of the cheese is compromised- even if only a bit- and remember that a quarter or half of some of these is still a substantial amount of cheese so a cheese shop that goes with either of these routes is working with a large quantity of product that is every so slightly handicapped.",
