As it stands we see no issue here but there is a small possibility that our funding (which is limited) may be cut short and our ability to maintain access to Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud may disappear. Currently we have enough funding to maintain access to the Creative Cloud tools through the end of the calendar year. See as how we plan to have the project finished by then, the loss of the development tools is only a possibility (and an extremely small one at that).

We have drafted a couple ideas for our music video and I guess in this department since we will be collaborating with film students that could take a little longer, but we will only move on to this once we have recorded the album.", 
            "Although we are very organised and have everything scheduled in for the next 6 months it is quite common in the music industry for there to be delays especially when working with so many people and considering how driven we are to never settle for anything less than astonishing. Whatever happens you will always be kept in the loop and our album will be released no matter what!"

As far as the musical content goes, most of the instrumentals have already been completed, the story has been written and so have my verses.

I have done some of these sketches on the plane en route to some city in the US for a work trip and I write some of my songs in the hotel at night after I leave the office. Now since I am doing all of the comic drawing myself, I set a pretty realistic delivery date to ensure I don\u2019t tick anyone off by being late.

We have secured funding from the Regional Art and Culture Council,  Oregon Community Foundation, Northwest Health Foundation and Oregon Jewish Community Youth Foundation.  Our show will go on even if we don't accomplish our Kickstarter.  However, it will mean a big difference for us. We will not be able to get all the costumes we need, we will not be able to hire a professional videographer nor a photographer to document our performance.  We also need funding to hire ASL interpreters and an Audio Describer to make our performance accessible for everyone!"

The worst that could happen is an unforeseen issue with our current choice of printer, but we have chosen two excellent backups just in case so production should not be sufficiently delayed in the event of disaster.", 
            "Ebook edition: Without the concern of printing a physical edition, there is virtually no risk with the ebook version.  As above, the book itself is already been written, it just needs to finish the editing process and be formatted into your favorite ebook format.", 
            "Book 2:  Some of the reward tiers include the second book of the series.  This gamebook is approximately 50% completed.  The tentative release window is late summer for book 2. This release window has been chosen judiciously, with knowledge of writing speed and leaving time for editing and formatting."

",

We will also get all the necessary information from the legal team with our professional organization in order to create clarity and limit this project to within a legal and ethical scope. In our community meeting prior to the event listeners will collaborate to trouble shoot these particular challenges and possible scenarios. ",

            "- LOCATION: The largest chunk of the budget will go towards paying for a location. The story takes place in a specific business located in an ethnic neighborhood. The character Sheila is forced to ask for help in a public place. We are looking to pay business owners, who will have to close their store for two days for us to shoot in their shops. We also have to pay someone from the store to supervise on set due to production safety requirements. ", 
            "- ART DIRECTION: To elevate the film\u2019s look, the location has an old-school aesthetic design to it. The shop is owned by a Russian immigrant. We will be buying and making Russian language posters for the store and its bathroom. Other props and costumes we will need include pastries to fill the shop, kitchen utensils, aprons, and black work pants. A visual motif in the story is the color red. So we will be buying red props such as red napkins and flowers. Because the story revolves around Sheila\u2019s stained shorts, my art team will buy several pairs of white shorts to test out the bloodstain. We will need to buy red dye and fake blood.  ", 
            "- TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT: Due to the large amount of camera equipment, lighting rigs, tripods, and electrical gear, we will rent a U-Haul truck for two full days to transport the equipment to set. We will be hiring drivers and renting a passenger van to drive the cast and crew to the location set as well.  ", 
            "- CAMERA EQUIPMENT: To achieve the desired comedy look, we will be renting a zoom lens, filters, and follow focus. Other smaller accessories include extra batteries, lighting meter, and disk drives.  ", 
            "- FOOD: Buying three full days of meals during the film shoot for all fifteen members of my cast and crew. My actors and crew members are all working for free on the project. The least I can do is offer them healthy meals, not carb loaded fast food, to stay energized on set.  ", 
            "Thank you for taking the time to read about this project. I am grateful for all the hardworking and passionate people who are supporting this movie. We would greatly appreciate any of your help! You are all helping to make this project become the best film that it can be! ",

I want to exceed expectations on this front once again like we did on our first three Kickstarter projects. So to once again help support this goal, we have already completed sculpting and initial master molding on the core set of miniatures. We have also performed test castings to ensure everything is dialed in from a pewter quality perspective. We have already had our pewter miniature caster set aside casting time and packing time so we can quickly get a head start on production as this campaign is underway. Just like with our first three Kickstarter projects, we will keep our backers in the loop with frequent updates throughout the run of this new Kickstarter project. All of our production and packing/shipping will take place in/from the Midwest USA.",

We are in our 13th year of business and have shipped orders out all over the world in the past 13+ years. We also completed and fully delivered on our first three Kickstarter projects. International shipping is expensive and this large release will be no exception. Dark Sword Miniatures has built a reputation of top notch quality and dependability over the years in regards to both our miniatures and our shipping turn times. And we aim to build upon that reputation once again with this new Kickstarter.",

But at the same time, overcoming those challenges is one of the most satisfying rewards life has to offer, which is why the film will most certainly get made if this Kickstarter is successful!",

Together with my wife and business partner Jennifer, we have over 54 years of combined experience in creating and implementing hundreds of creative projects for our commercial clients at Brickhouse Studios Inc, many much larger and more complex than this book project. We have outlined the project so that it\u2019s fully manageable with no major unknowns.

On her debut EP, Words Like Yours, her songs will sound familiar to fans of American roots music, but are tinged with Old World accents and surprising melismas and ornaments.  That\u2019s because she lays claim to more influences than most roots musicians today.\nShe was initially inspired by Celtic music, especially Irish fiddling and the highly-rhythmic Cape Breton fiddle style, eventually making her way to Old Time string band music and other Americana influences.  While in Boston, where she was attending the New England Conservatory, Henley tapped the local scene to connect with a younger generation of songwriters and instrumentalists, and has continued to work with top-flight young traditionalists like Rushad Eggleston, Brittany & Natalie Haas, and Tashina & Tristan Clarridge.  However, it was her move to Tel Aviv, Israel for three years that cemented her current work.  There Henley became inspired by the language and rhythms of Sephardic culture, music that she had first experienced as a young child. The flowing and bubbling vocal lines of Ladino music and language seeped into her own songwriting and brought a new repertoire. Never losing sight of her original interests in Celtic and American roots music, her new sound could be called Old World Americana. "

One listen to the Houston native's ethereal purr is enough to hook even the most casual music fan, and her song \"Lucky\" was featured on the MTV series United States of Tara. It was Edmonson's mother's record collection and old movies that initially stirred her artistic soul, but having a career in music wasn't initially a given. After a stint at college in Charleston, South Carolina, Edmonson returned to Texas and decided to follow the musical call. An audition for American Idol in 2002 landed Edmonson a trip to Hollywood and a spot in the Top 48. Her Idol dreams ended abruptly when judge Randy Jackson told the singer she didn't \"look like a star.\" After her exit from Idol, Edmonson began honing her chops at open-mike nights and eventually made the transition to full-time performer. Her debut album, 2009's Take to the Sky, was a mix of classic and modern songs, and proved Edmonson was more than ready for her jazz ascension. Three years later, she returned with the Kickstarter-funded Way Down Low. In 2014, Edmonson released the Mitchell Froom-produced The Big Picture. "

For the past three years, I have taken most of this work on with support from the already over stretched staff of The Amala Foundation.  We all see the impact of this program, so we do as much as we can to keep it running.  During the programs themselves there is an extraordinary vigor among our extended community and everyone can see, taste and feel what is happening.  However, once the week is over and there is much follow up work to be done, we feel the toll of \"volunteering\".  ",

Also, it is our hope that by staffing this role, we will also be able to grow further in our ability to spread our music to the world."

            "Right now, the biggest challenge is creating that fear, tension, and anxiety that we all feel when we watch a thriller or horror film.  The director and cinematographer have put a lot of time into designing a shot-list that we feel will emanate the fear of the leading character, Carolina.  This isn't a \"typical coverage\" type of movie.  Every shot, every camera movement, and lens have been specifically designed to immerse the audience into the tale of La Llorona.  We plan to play with shadows as visual representations, which the production designer and cinematographer are designing and testing ahead of time.  Because this is a student film, the post production should stay on schedule because of our deadline.  We're also shooting earlier than most of the other projects, giving our editor and sound designer more time than usual for student advanced productions."

My approach is already almost entirely different; more organized and more direct. I know what I want. I've been fantasizing about this for years! I have incredible people on board to play on the album, engineer the album and help me make this into something worth sharing.\nThe timing of an album is always hard. You want time to devote your best attention and energy to every step of the process. Funding, recording, mixing, mastering, printing, promoting, distributing... you speed up the process and things will get lost in the mix, you slow it down too much and everyone will forget you were even working on an album. The reality is that you want to make sure you're doing it right the first time. So, I'm hoping it will take me just a little over a year to get on with this project. I'm hoping. You're my inspiration, though, and I am tirelessly devoted to this and to those who are making it possible. With your assistance, I won't be delayed by the financial difficulties. Together this album will be the best that it can be."

The funding from this Kickstarter will allow us to hire the much-needed help to get the service completed but we are always balancing our day jobs with the volunteer work for Autism Village. We don\u2019t expect this risk to result in anything more than potential delays \u2013 and it\u2019s our goal to complete the software early \u2013 but it\u2019s a risk so we\u2019re noting it here.",

            "Hosting of this app will be in a cloud based service. This will have an ongoing cost and Autism Village does not yet have sufficient track record as a company, non-profit or otherwise (our non-profit filing is in process), to ensure that we\u2019ll be able to fund the hosting on an ongoing basis. As a result, we could run into issues with contracts with the cloud hosting provider accepting us as a customer. Of course, if we overachieve in our fundraising here on Kickstarter, we can prepay months or years of hosting. Various project founders might also be willing to co-sign for this hosting.",

This is always the case in any software/system project but we\u2019ve lots of experience in this and we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll get through it if it pops it\u2019s ugly head up.",

We are planning for good word of mouth and word spreading through the social networks on Facebook, Twitter, etc. to achieve this. We have not planned on much use of funds for promotion. If we\u2019ve underestimated the cost and effort to get the word out, and we don\u2019t overachieve our funding goal to make up for this, we could have a released app with too few users to be useful. If this becomes the case count on us to make every personal effort to get the word out and to raise more funds to help."

For instance, in 2013-2014, our first season after losing our founding co-director due to illness, we rebounded and increased the number of new works in production, toured a children's show to 20 public schools, doubled our budget, launched our fundraising infrastructure and started an outreach program that provides two weekly modern dance classes free of charge. We have self-produced three evening length works, hosted three works in progress showings and delivered two commissioned works for Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Greater than 50% of our events have been offered free to the public and more than half were produced as cross-disciplinary collaborations. The quality and quantity of our outreach in the community is unparalleled for an organization of our size.",

Ari has the professional experience of providing guidance to teaching artists and teachers in finding authentic connections, lesson plan writing and Best Practices in arts education. She holds degrees in Elementary Education and Humanities and has 10 plus years of teaching experience in school and studio environments including: Teacher Professional Developments, Teaching Artist PD\u2019s, Master Classes and Modern Dance Technique for Harwelden Institute, Oklahoma State University's ARtS Initiative, University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Tulsa, Union, Owasso and Jenks Public School Districts. She has also been invited to speak on the creative process at Living Arts of Tulsa, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and the National Creativity Network.",

After graduation, she worked in New York City for five years as a magazine editor, freelance writer, and dance critic. Her writing about dance has appeared in such publications as Dance Insider, Dance Teacher, and the Village Voice. She was named a finalist for a 2012 Great Plains Journalism Award for her dance writing in Urban Tulsa Weekly. Alicia is a prolific photographer and creative writer, as well as a freelance editor and proofreader. Founded in 2011, Alicia's blog Tulsa Dances is the first of its kind in Tulsa, providing in-depth interviews with major choreographers and information and essays about local dance.

TuMM\u2019s artistic leadership drew its education from the BFA program of Marymount Manhattan College, the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, from Tulsa Ballet, and from decades of artistic practice.  Since our unveiling -- a site-specific piece at the Arkansas River -- we've never been content just to present work on a stage. As dancers and choreographers we draw inspiration from real bodies and emotional states, real places, real relationships -- and our work reaches back into those realities, opening up those who engage with us to new ways of looking, listening, and moving in their own lives. We are a company of strong, committed dancers. For full company bios please visit our About page at www.TuMMdance.org"

            "The challenges of creating this product have been to redesign my current RooSport 2.0 so it will comfortably and securely carry the larger phones being made today.  This has not been easy.  It has been important to keep it comfortable and also secure.  \nIf you are traveling and carrying your Passports, credit cards, etc.. I wanted to be able to design it so that it was easily concealed with light clothing.  \nIf you will use it for athletic activities like the gym or running or walking I had to redesign the magnet to be sure it was strong enough to hold on your waistband and make sure it doesn't bounce or bother you.  The results of testing:  It doesn't!  \nThe challenge for the user is to wear clothes that have a snug waist band or one they can tie.  Since you may be putting a large phone in a case in it you will have to be able to do that so that your shorts do not fall down a bit.  In my tests have shown it is awesome!  \nWe have eliminated a manufacturing risk as we have moved our factory (during our last project) to the USA!  Not having it in China makes it easier for communication and oversight during the manufacturing process.  \nI am confident that we will deliver our product on or before the stated time frame of May 2015."

I completed much work while at the cathedral, with many carvings in the public domain throughout the city and across the country.",

That's where effective publicity and marketing will come in, including newspaper ads in arts sections of Wellington papers and a radio interview with commissioned composer Mark Smythe.", 
            "The time frame for composition and rehearsal is intensive. However, Baroque Voices are already familiar with the Monteverdi, Body, Bowater & Smythe works, and Mark is committed to producing the newly-commissioned work in just one week. He recently orchestrated 22 minutes of music for 13 film cues in just 12 days, so his writing output will be up to the task. Mark will also be joining Baroque Voices in New Zealand for all rehearsals, and corresponding directly with Pepe Becker during the writing process.", 
            "The concert date has been carefully timed to avoid clashes with other significant cultural events, which is always a risk, particularly as May is New Zealand Music Month. There're also many classical performances centred around ANZAC Day (25 April), however we believe this will merely prime audiences for more."

If we surpass our minimal funding goals we should be able to build cold-frames with old windows and ply-board to extend the season and buffer the plants against erratic weather. With extra funding we can also purchase some natural soil amendments that would improve the health of our plants, making them less susceptible to disease and pests.\n\nWhy Our Project Won't Be So Risky or Challenging:",

We take risks when we incorporate beef tongue into our mostly vegan menu, and this is because we are aware of our community and want to be inclusive; meat eaters and vegans should be able to find food at the same restaurant. There is a lot we can learn from people with differing eating habits. We have an unique outlook and that's what people appreciate in us; it is why we stand out and why we will continue to grow.\nAdditionally, we are located in a food desert where there is no other place to get food within seven blocks that isn't corner store or fast food.

Such an incident might indicate on one of two options: \n(a) there are no more leopards left within this study area. \n(b) there is perhaps one last individual left in the entire study area. ",

This data is important for future conservation efforts for this endangered species.", 
            "The used method provides a census-like abundance check in which 95% of the population is expected to be encountered. That means that if the population is of one last individual we still have a chance of missing it. As far as for the study's success evaluation. If all camera-locations remained functioning for the entire 60 days then even if we got no pictures of leopards it is still considered as a successful study as it will indicate that further studies should concentrate on other regions than this.",

Nonetheless, since other people may pass in some of the locations there is a risk of theft.

I know this is my first Kickstarter project but everyone has to start somewhere right? This is my shot!. I've dreamed of an opportunity like this so I am not going to take it for granted. I am going to give it my all! One of the challenges is the commissioned artwork, I have therefore given myself enough time to complete the drawings that will be requested by the backers. All I ask for is a little patience to get you a quality product. I take great care in producing an immaculate piece for you. You will have the option to request the art book first and then I'll send the artwork once it's completed. The next risk is the printers. Please rest assured that I am using a printing service that has been used by a fellow kickstarter and is guaranteed for quality and reliability."

The creation of this film so far has called upon the contributions of professionals and students of the cinema alike, bringing together a small yet passionate community dedicated to contributing to the growth of the cinema through the expression of seldom heard independent voices.  However, the primary limitation of cinematic expression is it's reliance on funding of a larger scale than most art forms.  it is for this reason that we need your help.  Although we have completed half of the film we have unfortunately stretched our resources to their maximum, leaving us in a position in which we have chosen to call out to you; our friends and family, fellow cinephiles, and anyone interested in contributing to the work of a small group of passionate individuals.  We have all poured our hearts and souls into this work and to be able to see it fully realized is a privilege we will surely not take for granted.  Thanks for reading and see you at the movies!"

This means that when we upgrade to the 160-gallon fermentation vessels, it will take time for the culture to adapt to its new conditions and for our kombucha to achieve consistency. We will also have to learn how to work with this new equipment, as we had to when we went from our home-brew fermentation vessels to the vessels we use now. This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. To address this issue, we will continue to brew using our current 26-gallon fermentation vessels until we have mastered the new equipment and consistency is achieved in these vessels."

It has taken more than a year and so many prototypes back and forth to reach the goal of a perfect mix of elegance, comfort, waterproofness and ecofriendlyness. And price. We want to keep production local but this is not possible at the moment, mainly because sewing factories have closed down in Denmark and our neighbouring countries. And the European factories that are still there AND are ecofriendly are SO expensive (understandable) rendering the Takaokami rain gear unobtainable for most. So what to do? Well, the bigger the quantities the smaller the unit price, and that is what we are aiming for.",

Luckily I have had many experiences making records (three solo records and numerous band records) and feel confident in handling any issues that may arise.  I know how to make a realistic plan and timeline for recording, how to work with other musicians and how to get CDs into the hands of folks who appreciate the music.  Perhaps what I am most grateful for, and which makes all the difference with any up-coming challenges, are the wonderful folks I will be working with.  I have made two records with our recording engineer, the wonderful Joe DeJarnette.  Dick Harrington, Pat Egan, Ned Oldham and Tom Marshall will also be involved with this project and all are veteran musicians with plenty of recording experiences.  Plus they are all fantastic human beings.  ", 
            "The songs and tunes are well-practiced and we will be ready to record by our early May reserved studio dates.  After that, we need to mix and master the CD, work on cover graphics, get the CDs duplicated and then fulfill our promises to deliver the goods.  The December 2015 deadline is more than enough time to do all this and I expect that it will be late summer or fall when the finished project is in our hands."

The only hiccup we've encountered is with the base, the colored piece that serves as the platform for the the measuring cap to rotate within.  The bottom of the base is supposed to be flat, but its basic geometry, coupled with the properties of the material  is resulting in inconsistency of the piece when coming off of the mold. One piece might come out ok, and the next might have one level of curvature, and the next might have a different level. This is creating rotation issues as the bottom of the measuring cap is getting stuck on the curve.  ",

I didnt see all the costs coming so it took me a long time to save up the extra money to get the actual finished product in my hand.\nThis time I have done the math and gotten quotes for each of these and they all are within our goal amount.\nThe one thing that might hold this up would be a production delay on the side of the record or CD pressing companies, but I am working to book a reservation to avoid this.  Even if there is a delay it should only be a few weeks.  Just in case I rounded up on production time and set the time of release in September.  Lets hope it happens sooner!\nAs mentioned before in the project description, all 5 of the band have been working on the side for a demolition company to save $500 each for this project, we are all in.

The most challenging element will be conveying the emotion and human aspect of the script. It will be a daunting prospect to bring these emotion driven characters to life - which is why we\u2019ll need great actors. This film is set very much in the world we live in, despite the few years difference in setting. Therefore, the production design needs to be superb to bring the world to life and make it feel authentic for the actors and the audience. Finally, perhaps the most challenging aspect of this film is that it is a current issue and we need to do it justice. This is our goal and we will overcome every challenge we face to succeed."

            "In any self-run business there is always the risk of running into challenges whether it's relying on other people to come through on time or running into issues with production.  The first risk is that even we are setting our goal for $15,000, the brutal truth is that we will likely need much more than that to ensure the ability to do our first production run.  However, we have concluded that if we hit our goal and fall short of our stretch goals we are prepared to go ahead and finance with our own savings to ensure the production of Earth Encounters.  That is how dedicated we are to getting this game out into the world.  ", 
            "As for the actual production and manufacturing of the game, this is our first time doing a Kickstarter campaign so the process is fairly new to me and my father.  However, I have surrounded myself with the strongest team of successful supporters who are dedicated to helping us see this dream turn to reality.  In that, we feel confident going forward with this Kickstarter."

            "Safety is my biggest concern, especially when dealing with the epoxy coatings that are used on the surface of the foam to harden it.  The most efficient method of application is with a hopper gun.  However, this introduces epoxy to the air in a fine mist which is very dangerous if inhaled.  The best solution is to build a paint booth with filters for the incoming and outgoing air.  When using the booth I will need to wear a supplied air respirator with full face mask.\n  In addition, I must ensure that all projects are made using food safe materials where applicable.  The easiest solution is to use commercial food-grade containers and plumbing around which I build my sculptures.  This is somewhat limiting for my designs however.  The next stage of development will be to build a vacuum form table which will allow me to create liners from food grade plastic sheets in whatever shape is needed.  I am constantly researching new methods of production for all of my projects and engineering my space and processes is as much fun to me as sculpting itself."

Ideally, we would like to have them participate in the final exhibit, since we will be incorporating live performance elements in the gallery. This will all depend on several crucial factors: the availability of the students (as this is finals period) during our residency period (since Holy Week and Easter fall right in between) and our final budget. As such, for the time being, this remains a big question mark.",

            "Risks\nFrom a strategic viewpoint The Polymath is rather simple.  If we get the writers and the subscribers and we successfully monetize, it is the proverbial 'no brainer'.  However, none of the three are assured.", 
            "Writers\nThere are about 500,000 people at or above 3.3 sigma in Intellectual Sophistication and we want the fifty or so best of them.  We will not start out with them, however, our initial writing team will be good enough.  As our subscription base increases, the payment for an article will increase and we will be better able to attract the best writers.  Our asymptote on circulation of 6,000,000 translates to a payment on a 8 page article of 6,000\u00d75\u00d78\u00d740%=$96,000.  So the risk is not so much in acquiring the quality writers, but rather in the circulation and CPI assumptions.", 
            "There is a general risk concerning rate of growth in writers.  The more writers we have, the more ad producing pages and, therefore, the more budget for increasing circulation.  The larger the circulation, the more writers will earn.  If circulation growth is too low, it may prove difficult to attract and retain writers.", 
            "Circulation\nThe most important risk overall is the assumption of self financing subscriber growth.  The 30% Polymathic Institute portion from one subscriber must be sufficient to acquire more than one new subscriber.  If it is, the self financed circulation growth is divergent to market saturation.  ", 
            "The first year Polymathic Institute portion for a 64 page weekly publication at $5 CPM is $16.64.  Compared to our current 38.5\u00a2 subscriber acquisition cost, the risk appears small.  If it was not, we wouldn't be doing this crowd funding.", 
            "Monetizing\nOur closest comparable is The Economist, which charges about $80 CPM per page in its print edition.  Since we are electronic but not Internet, we consider $30 CPM to be conservative.  Generally, the display ad will be replaced with a clickable ad when the article is placed in the Archives.  There we will prefer affiliate ads over CPC but we will offer both.", 
            "In the end, though our $2-$3 CPM for a banner ad seems conservative, our CPM will be what advertisers can justify based upon results.  Blogs are typically charging $1-$2 CPM.  On the other hand Technorati reports CPMs as high as $25 for some blogs.  While Polymathicans are thought leaders who multiply awareness beyond the initial impression, in the end, $5 CPM per page (header and footer banner ads) may be too high an assumption.  That, however, while disappointing will not destroy our financial viability.  A 64 page magazine at $2 CPM per page still generates $2 per subscriber for the Polymathic Institute, still well above the cost of acquisition.  A writer will receive $6,400 per million circulation for an eight page article at $2 CPM which should attract and retain quality writers.", 
            "Conclusion\nWhile this project most certainly has risks, they are reasonable and worth taking.  In the end The Polymath simply needs to exist in the new Information Age global civilization.  At a minimum it will challenge our thought leaders and change agents to think in new directions while providing some of the inappropriately excluded with an appropriate productive outlet."

We have researched several companies that can handle this type of project and have relied heavily on the opinions of local businesses and customers.  We have narrowed the list down to the two most qualified and have gained a consensus that either group has the competency and time available to get the job done in time.  We have also budgeted an extra two weeks of time beyond what is expected to allow for the completion of the renovations, the certification from the state, and the move.  We have also been able to set aside some of the businesses funds (approximately 15% of the budget request) to act as an emergency fund in case we do go over budget due to unforeseen events.",

I will need to hire an editor to polish the text and depending on the final budget, I could add extra features It has crossed already my mind like: an unique ribbon book mark, audiobook in English and Spanish, sticker sheets, an original version of Clara\u2019s favorite red bag, etc.\n2.\tWill also need to check any additional legal considerations before this book is printed.\n3.\tDepending if I happen to meet the minimum quantity or just how many units I need to print at the end, getting the artwork ready, printing and shipping could very well take a couple months, but I\u2019m confident to be able to deliver them by September just in time for the people getting ready for the gift giving season! hoping you can impress many of your pals with this!\n4.\tFor the people that can\u2019t wait this long I will make sure to forward you the e-book as soon as is completed."

The length of time we have spent developing the work, the scale of the production, the number of \"Bellagio\" surround events planned, and the size of the audience we intend to reach, are our most ambitious goals to date.  We are an energetic and determined company, and we have always pushed ourselves to explore new paths, new mediums and new ways of relating to our audiences. It is fundamental to our creative process that we discover and then explore the appropriate means to realize a production. Even though we realized that the environment for \"Bellagio\" needed to be large-scale, active, flowing water, we were thrilled by the possibilities and got started.  We are so looking forward to bringing \"The Bellagio Fountain has been known to Make Me Cry\" to life and flooding Brooklyn with its waters."

We self-financed and published 2000 copies of \u201cJack and the Zombie Attack\u201d, we had a successful book release party with over 1000 people in attendance, we won over Barnes and Noble with our unique marketing strategies, and we overcame a 6-year Comic Con waiting list in a single attempt.",

            "We have controlled our chaotic crazy life by making many new friends to share it with.  With these strong ties, very few obstacles are foreseen, the biggest obstacle being financing the production of the book. After a failed Kickstarter event in 2012, many believed \"Jack and the Zombie Attack\" couldn't be done.  We refused to settle for defeat, and self-financed the book for $9,600.  Of the $9,600 we spent last year to produce 2000 copies of \u201cJack and the Zombie Attack\u201d, we have made our money back and that is it.", 
            "Now our obstacle is to produce 2000 copies of \u201cJack and the Pirate Attack\u201d and if we can make extra money pay to throw another release party that is a swashbuckling affair. So yes, we have set our humble goal at $4,500, but we are pushing to reach a stretch goal of $9,200 to cover the cost of the production of 2,000 books. If you didn't back us before, you have the choice now to say....I believed in them from the beginning."

            "The challenge with both of these options is that inevitably the quality of the cheese is compromised- even if only a bit- and remember that a quarter or half of some of these is still a substantial amount of cheese so a cheese shop that goes with either of these routes is working with a large quantity of product that is every so slightly handicapped.",

More and more the film industry is looking to produce generic and risk-averse marketing campaigns where the movies are an after-thought. But Kickstarter gives you, the audience, the opportunity to short-circuit that. I came to New York City in the early 1980s, the time of punk rock. In rundown lofts and tenements, artists, filmmakers and musicians challenged the status quo and embraced the complexity of life. From out of my experiences in 1980s New York, I learned to embrace risk and it has informed every project I\u2019ve worked on subsequently \u2013 whether it was subverting the gaze in my first feature, VARIETY, a film shot at a porn theater, or exploring the taboos in a mother-son relationship in LUMINOUS MOTION. This project, BORDER CROSSING, is no different."

            "Faux Paz is a 17-member ensemble comprised of full-time undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines across the University of Maryland. This competition is a culmination of our hard work from this year and all the efforts from all 22 years of our history. Competing on this international level, we have the honor of representing the University of Maryland. As college students, academics are our priority; however, we all devote much of our spare time to creating this musical experience.  We face the challenges of time management, budgeting our limited funds, and transporting such a large group of people. Unfortunately, our Student Government Association does not assist with travel expenses or lodging, our two main expenses for this trip.  Participating in the ICCA finals is an incredible opportunity that will most likely be a once-in-a-lifetime experience."

Suicide is a sensitive subject and recently at the forefront of contemporary cultural dialogue. Throwing erotic asphyxiation into the mix digs can only dig us into a deeper hole, right?", 
            "We like to think the opposite. By engaging our audience with a clever, if morbid, premise we believe we can tell the story that deserves to be told, which is at heart about a boy's struggle to find validation despite the harsh realities of modern home-life and media saturation",

With [re]CLAIM, Nazmo Dance Collective is moving outside the box. We are working with emerging mediums and structures in order to find new and more meaningful ways to connect to audiences. In previous years, Nazmo Dance Collective has worked on a smaller scale, producing quality work through small individual monetary and in-kind donations. These smaller productions have allowed the company to grow with success. In order to continue growing, reach new audiences and begin producing larger-scale work that does not sacrifice quality, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

            "The risks are minor. The game is done, it's established, and it's refined through years of development and playtesting. Manufacturing and fulfillment have already been arranged. The challenge will be drawing enough of the right attention to the game so that we can reach our goal.",

            "Q: Who will be handling the manufacturing?\nA: WinGo Game Manufacturing.", 
            "Q: Who will be handling fulfillment?\nA: Amazon for the USA, Spiral Galaxy will likely handle UK/Euro fulfillment, and I will personally handle fulfillment in Canada.", 
            "Q: Are you Sean MacDonald, designer of The Crow and the Pitcher?\nA: No, I'm Sean McDonald, not MacDonald. Our first and last name are very common, but we are not the same person.", 
            "Q: Why offer an 'Early Backer Bonus'?\nA: Though we may have established a good backer community from our previous KS, we're still fairly new to the board game scene. Early backers are incredibly important in demonstrating to others that this game is going to be supported and funded. Additionally, we are aiming for a loftier goal in order to bring a higher quality product to you right as soon as the game is funded. This means we greatly need starting momentum early in the campaign. No matter how good a product is, if potential backers don't see support for it they in turn will likely pass right by it as the campaign matures. Our hope is that backers that missed out on this Early Backer Bonus offer understand this, and do not feel left out by knowing our intention is not to upset them but merely to get the game to them. We acknowledge that your pledge is supporting the campaign to a greater degree, and we truly thank you for it.", 
            "Q: Can Train Heist be played solo, with just one player?\nA: Though the game is designed with 2-4 players in mind, like most co-operative board games it can be played solitaire. Special 'Solo Play' punchboard tokens will be included that will assist players in playing a mock 2-4 player game by themselves, playing as all characters. The tokens will be color-coordinated to match the cowboy pieces, so that Poker Hands and Loot/Bullet Tokens can be kept in order, and will be numbered so player order can be kept track of.", 
            "Q: Will your Stretch Goals eventually add anything to the game itself?\nA: Future Stretch Goals, should funding continue, will include further component upgrades such as box or insert upgrades, etc. No more game components will be added, but merely upgraded. We want to make our backers aware the game they are receiving upon funding is already a complete and high quality game. We will not cancel the project merely because it doesn't reach a certain Stretch Goal we had in mind initially, as is a recent trend on Kickstarter. That would be a highly dishonest and deceitful method of tricking backers into thinking they're getting more game for their dollar by using Stretch Goals, when in reality the Stretch Goals are adding necessary components always intended for the game. Tower Guard Games does not condone this and feels this harms the Kickstarter community and crowd-funding in general, and that is why we want to be forthright and honest to our backers in this regard.", 
            "Q: Why did you use animals over humans?\nA: A game's art should represent the nature of the game. Elements of the game lend themselves to a more exaggerated, almost cartoon-like view of the American \"Wild West\", and thus the game wasn't meant to take itself seriously (i.e. at points during the game the train leaves the board and pops out on the other side). To avoid gamers approaching this game in that manner and being disappointed, I decided to have a more light- hearted approach to the art, while keeping a gritty feel. This gives a good general context to those approaching this game for the first time. That said, if given enough demand, who knows what the future brings?"

The only risk that you take on your end is investing, but not getting to watch the final product because the film goes unmade. If we can\u2019t raise the funds, your amazing donation will go unused. In other words, the higher risk in our project (the more you help us out), the higher the return (the better the movie will turn out). So many amazing films have been made on small budgets and our team is confident this film can enter that category. ",

Issues of copyright and trademarks will need to be addressed if this project really takes off but already based on legal advice received it is possible to overcome these obstacles with right support and further expert advice.\nWriter's block is also something to be aware of - but as I am currently working already on a third istallment, I know that I have many more SuperYam\u2122 adventures in me."

All of the art prints you can choose from are ready to go, so once the campaign is over you are guaranteed to get your fine art print as soon as possible. Remember prints are available on a first pledge first serve basis.  It is possible that the photo you want could sell out but the chance of this happening is unlikely. That being said it's a good idea to  have a second choice in mind.",

I have priced the books at a rate so that I can afford to have a short run of very special edition books just for you.  This is included in my budget.  I will probably run another kickstarter to raise money for mass production of the BARE USA book once I have photographed all of the states but this has no bearing on current backers. The biggest risk here is completing the project as a whole, which I explain in greater detail below.",

The sponsor a state options is on a first pledge basis meaning those who pledge first get first choice on the available states.  Once a state is sponsored is no longer available to anyone else. All websites and social media outlets are in place and running smoothly, gaining more traffic every day so your shout outs are sure to be heard loud and clear.  The other risks are the same as those stated above and below.",

There may be locations I am unable to shoot at but there are an abundance of abandoned locations in every state so an alternative is always available.  There is no shortage of models interested in participating in this project so if one should cancel there are always others available.",

            "One of the biggest challenges Uprooted will face is finding our customers. People buy flowers for particular events but they are also often an \u201cimpulse buy.\u201d The problem with impulse buying in NYC is once you've bought something, you have to trek it home over the river and through the streets. Although Uprooted's bouquets are travel ready, we still need to catch people who are headed home or to the event for which they need flowers. So we\u2019ll need your help!! Let us know where you want Uprooted to be! As our business develops, we will need to listen to our clients\u2019 needs and adapt our practices to provide NYC with fresh flowers!", 
            "Another major challenge will be balancing how much inventory to keep on the truck. Our generator can run on gas and electricity so that the cooler can be plugged in overnight. This feature will facilitate turnover of product from day to day, but part of Uprooted\u2019s mission is to reduce waste by keeping a smaller inventory on the truck, so determining how much to purchase and when will be tricky. We want to have enough blooms for everyone who stops by the truck, but we also don\u2019t want to be throwing lots of flowers away! Unfortunately, this will be a trial and error process, which is part of the reason we need help with operating costs. Uprooted needs the cushion Kickstarter will provide to allow for experimentation with truck location and inventory management.", 
            "Our limited inventory concept is also a risk. We may be alienating customers who are looking for a specific type of flower or have strong color preferences. Uprooted hopes to convert the naysayers by introducing them to new varieties and playful designs. We want people to branch out! Lilies may be your favorite flower, but if Uprooted is on your way to work, you may get dahlias this week and realize you love them on your desk too!", 
            "Overall, our biggest challenge is getting the word out so people know New York is getting its first florist on wheels \u2013 help us spread the word and put people on the look-out for Uprooted Flower Truck!"

            "The risks we face are similar to all projects like this. Did we budget correctly? Are we realistic in our timeline? What we CAN say is that if we raise the funds, we WILL complete the film. We've done it before and now that we know what we are doing, we can do it again. By nature, we are optimistic, else we would not even begin. The risk is that we are overly optimistic that we can get it done as quickly as we hope. Perhaps interviewees will not be available when we hope. Perhaps the right editor will be booked on another project. Perhaps the manufacturing companies will have a slow turnaround. When Luxury made \"Trophies\" we expected to have vinyl pressed at a certain facility. When we were ready to send the final master we asked what the turnaround was. Their answer was \"6 months\". So, we found a vinyl manufacturer in the Czech Republic who could do it in a little less than 3 months.  This is the most likely risk. No matter when we conservatively estimate that we will be finished, there are unknowns. Rest assured, though, when we are funded, we are committed to complete it. Hopefully on time."

An efficient drip irrigation system that delivers the proper amount of water to plants without any waste and evaporation requires careful planning.

Students will be trained in the installation and maintenance of the lines, as well as the programming of timers. We've also got hose bibs planned throughout the garden to hook up to whenever we need running water.",

            "There are always risks when you are making a film, be it a six minute short or a sixty minute full-length. The biggest risk, and the one that occurs the most often, is scheduling mishaps. It is incredibly common for something to \u201ccome up\u201d at the last possible second for anyone involved in the project, myself included, which could potentially cut in to the time you are supposed to be filming, and can result in major setbacks. To prevent this, I plan to have a full, detailed schedule of filming completed by early April, a full two months before filming, so that everyone is on the same page well in advance. \n        Another major risk is the risk of technological glitches. Sometimes cameras break, and you\u2019re left without a way to shoot an essential scene. Sometimes computers crash, and that can result in losing days of precious filming. I plan to combat these unpredictable, yet preventable obstacles simply by being prepared. This is not my first film, and I have encountered many technological setbacks in my time as a film-maker. Because of this, I am prepared to deal with whatever life throws at me. \n        I feel that with my experience, combined with the experience of the many extremely talented people who will be helping to make this film a reality, we will be more than capable of handling any problems that come our way."

We have set a delivery date of July 2015, it's possible that we may be able to send out rewards before July, but we want to allow for the unforseen problems that might arise. Although it's very unlikely, sudden price increases in metal before we can fullfill the rewards would cause us a problem. Postage is a risk outside our control, items getting delayed or even lost, we will use Royal Mail or other reliable courier and we will keep a proof of postage.

The old tape machines - two-inch for recording, half-inch for mixing - are amazingly-built machines, however they require a good deal of care and maintenance to keep them running properly. Fortunately, The Studio has Dan Selim, a live-in technician who worked with Lou Whitney for years - he literally lives above the studio. A worst-case scenario is that we may have to order a part for one of the machines, which might set us back 10 working days or so. Otherwise, our material is road-tested and Cindy and I have many, many collective hours of experience in the studio. Our visual and graphics artists are people with whom we have long professional and personal relationships. We are confident that barring an act of God, we will easily meet our projected release date of Tuesday, July 14, 2015."

A more likely threat, though less serious, is the possible delays involved. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced good results on game projects in the past. Second, Dr. Finn's Games has successfully completed each Kickstarter campaign on time (though we are presently in the end phase of the Biblios Dice campaign, but still on time) and understands how to keep the project on track. If any delays do unexpectedly occur, supporters will be notified promptly."

We have a track record that includes a New England Emmy nomination and a commitment for at least 10 films in the series to be marketed by American Public Television (APT) to the entire PBS affiliates.  Our most recently released documentary Imber's Left Hand about Jon Imber, the New England painter who lived a fulfilling life to the very end in spite of his deteriorating condition from ALS is bringing more attention to the rest of the series.  That film is now being distributed by Film Movement, a highly reputable distributor with a terrific track record that will help get that film seen by a very significant number of viewers.  And that will help propel the rest of the series into the limelight.  ", 
            "The challenge is raising the dollars to complete the J. Fred Woell film within the schedule that we have set for ourselves -- completion date  September 2016.  Another challenge is finding the financial backers who believe in Fred's vision of America -- a peaceful nation that demonstrates concern for social justice and environmental sensitivity.  ",

Daniel is also busy working full time as a music producer. However, we both believe that our passions will come through in the end. Late night recording sessions are expected, along with consistent communication to stay on the same page. We trust in the support of our friends and family to understand our circumstances, in the case of a delay. The EP is expected to release late July 2015, but we expect no later than early fall this year. But be assured we are working as hard as we can. We thank everyone in advance for believing in us!"

            "Since our first project we have learnt a great deal about releasing products in Australia and abroad while working with our partnered factories abroad. The biggest issue we faced was getting our and ideas across to the production team without the process getting lost in translation. To rectify this we spent months looking for the right manufacturing partner that could not only meet our high demand for quality but could relate to us in a way that helped our ideas come to fruition. Another challenge dealing with an overseas manufacturing partner is that their working holidays are different to ours, meaning that orders could be delayed. To avoid this we have synced our working calendars to clearly be able to forecast ordering and production times. This has been an excellent advantage for both us, our manufacturing team and customers. They know when to expect orders and we know when to expect delivery."

Good news is, you'll have so much fun printing massive objects with Gigabot, you'll no longer care about that stuff.

To avoid potential of production delays due to unexpected part shortage or late supplier delivery, we are currently procuring inventories of all parts in advance of Kickstarter campaign. In addition, as a beta stage prototype, Gigabot's functionality and design will be continually improved and iterated over the course of the next several months. As such, we can't be sure about the printer's final performance metrics and specifications. Finally, the utility of Gigabot's printable output is inherently dependent on the structural properties of the plastic input filament material. Thus, it may not be suitable for all intended uses. re:3D is currently working on improving the versatility and structural integrity of input materials, so stay tuned for future product innovations.",

            "When we got involved in the All Dock project, we always felt very uncomfortable because we were in a weak position to manage the risk. The project was sourcing from different companies that did not talk to each other, and it was questionable whether we were dealing with a trading company or actual manufacturer.  We parachuted into the project to get it delivered. There was no quality management system, nor was there an IT infrastructure to support fulfillment and customer service. What we experienced was typical of many Kickstarter projects, making them very risky. ", 
            "We founded the Plashr platform because of our risky experience.  Our goal with Plashr is to mitigate the manufacturing risk and to build the infrastructure to better distribute our products and serve our customers globally.  We did it by partnering and offering a compelling value proposition to the right manufacturers.  With a manufacturer in the founding team, we are now vertically integrated with access to everything PCB (design, assembly and firmware programming), injection molding design/production and product assembly.  We are also putting in place a Quality Management System across the entire supply chain, including at our supplier factory.  In short, we are addressing the risk at the root of the problem.  ", 
            "Nevertheless, there will still be unforeseen circumstances going forward.  Some we can foresee early, but some may pop up during execution.  For example, we have been told there is a backlog in the supply of Apple-certified chipsets for lightning connectors.  We are still engineering our circuitboard to combine Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 and existing USB handshake protocols/standards. We will announce how we will support Quick Charge 2.0 at 9V, 12V and 20V. ", 
            "On the fulfillment front, we are working with logistic companies to pin down the most efficient and cost effective way to ship in the USA, EU countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and Greater China with no shipping and import duty/tax.  Our goal is not to make money on shipping but to lower the cost of ownership of our product for everyone around the world.  Today, we know where we can send with no shipping charges, and many countries have no import duty/tax below a certain amount. For the rest of the countries (not listed above) we have to impose a $20 shipping surcharge.  As we uncover ways to ship to new countries, we will update you.  If you know of a cheaper and effective way to ship to your country, please let us know. ", 
            "Finally, we would like to add that our challenges go beyond Kickstarter.  Kickstarter is a valuable launchpad to connect with our backers. We would be doing a disservice to our backers if we did not grow and bring more innovations to market.  The Plashr brand is also the platform for how we are going to get there.  We are developing the capability of selling online everywhere, including China."

            "This Kickstarter campaign aims to introduce power-based training to the running community. Even though it has long been the standard for training in cycling, power is new to the running world. There is no prior knowledge how to use power to guide day-by-day training and racing. Such knowledge needs to be created and then disseminated among the running community. We believe this is the biggest risk of bringing power, such a disruptive metric, to running.\n\nThis is also the reason why we launch this Kickstarter campaign. Over the past three years, we have been working with runners, coaches, and sports physiologists in the Boulder area. Kickstarter offers a great platform to reach the running community worldwide. Through this campaign, we would like to work with runners worldwide to collect and analyze running power data. We would like to support coaches and sports physiologists to investigate and develop power-based training programs. We would like to collaborate with third-party training platforms to disseminate power-based training knowledge to everyone who wants to run better, faster, and safer. \n\nAnother potential common risk in the wearable space is hardware fabrication. Our team has been working with multiple reputable manufacturers in China since 2011. Our hardware engineers spend many months of their time each year in China, working with the ODM/OEM engineers on the same manufacture floor. We do not foresee further challenges on the hardware fabrication side.  We promise to do our best to deliver Stryd with high quality in the summer."

I'm experimenting with a filament detection system from Tunell.\n3. Use Octoprint for remote control and monitoring to keep an eye on your print.\n4. Don't be afraid to resume stopped prints.\n5. Use the included support system to stabilize your print.\n6. Find and share your knowledge and thoughts on the Ultimaker forum!",

            "(1) Pricing: We are pricing our service based on the projected volume, and cost of materials, staff, insurance, and ongoing maintenance. However, residents in Beacon are not accustomed to paying upfront for waste removal because it's built into our taxes. As waste disposal costs are rising across the country and food waste remains unaddressed, we think it's critical to build a composting program in response. Many Beaconites agree and are backyard composting already, but our service aims to address apartment dwellers and businesses. Our pricing, $40 for residences and $105 for businesses, raises questions of equity and access to this service. Through the help of the initial participants, who we consider early investors, we will be able to scale up and run an efficient and increasingly cost effective program that grows to be accessible citywide.", 
            "(2) Training + feedback: Identifying the correct feedback system for participants and our staff will take time. We want to continuously improve our trainings for our participants, especially in commercial kitchens, to make sure composting is easy and it's easy for us to catch any mistakes. Like everything else, this pilot is intended to test our approach and refine it.", 
            "(3) Routes: Only by actually running the routes will we be able to make the routes faster and more streamlined for our pick up staff. Additionally, we will be testing the locations for participants to leave their food waste outside for pick up to ensure that it is undisturbed, not collected with regular garbage and recycling, and easy to access by our staff."

            "The most obvious challenge I face in completing this project is in predicting when the best window to hold the event will be. While some other kayaking events are scheduled around dam release rivers, this event requires snowmelt to raise the rivers to the appropriate level, and it also requires warm enough temperatures for any ice bridges that may have formed over the canyon to clear. \u00a0Its not an exact science, but I'm confident that I can predict when the gorge will melt and open up based upon my own personal experience with the place and input from fellow \npaddlers. The worst case scenario would reschedule the race by a week or two, due to hazardous conditions. Other minor concerns include last minute adjustments in order sizes for t-shirts, or a delay in making copies of the race footage, but I feel confident that all rewards will be delivered by the estimated delivery date."

Instead when you work so hard on a problem that is assumed impossible and produce little no one is going to read your work. However, Mr. Snyder explains that it is a learning process and not just a ploy to produce garbage math. In creating this problem Mr. Snyder has had to research geometry, trigonometry, and number theory. This while reading as much as he could about cryptography. This problem is serious. It is not a joke. It is finding a pattern in multiplication using only elementary math.",

            "The fundamental challenge that LIGHTNING BUGS IN A JAR faces in succeeding as a Kickstarter campaign is comparable to the challenges that the film faces in a greater context. How do we foster support for the future of the film among friends and family, let alone those who do not know us personally, when the market is saturated with comparable forms of content, across countless platforms? One immediate challenge that we face is garnering enough attention to get industry professionals into theaters and viewing rooms at the Cannes Short Corner, where our competition among other projects is formidable. As a small \u2018fish\u2019 in a very large \u2018pond\u2019 of exceptional short films from around the globe, LIGHTNING BUGS\u2026 ultimately has to be seen and experienced in order for it to connect with people. While we are confident in our work as artists and are tremendously proud of the film, we acknowledge that the market for short films today is increasingly competitive, perhaps more so than ever before. As attention spans continue to shorten, the tradition of going to a theater to see a movie has become both endangered and sacred. The array of ways in which people consume entertainment seems limitless and geared more toward portability and viewer convenience than supporting the standard movie-going experience.",

I am prepared to meet these challenges, especially the latter, as we at MacCurdy Farm are year round farm product salesman at our local Restigouche Farmers' Market in Dalhousie, NB, where samples and sales are expected to be fair alongside our other products following a successful first year.  On top of this, continued marketing of the product via my facebook farm page, Nature's Estate Farm, www.facebook.com/naturesestatefarm, as well as the MacCurdy Farm facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/pages/Maccurdy-Farm/326323597503573, and Justin's blogsite, http://maccurdyfarm.com, will be utilized. Other defined options include other local social media outlets and those interested persons included within our farming/food production network of other Atlantic Canadian producers, distributors, restaurants, and food outlets are to be considered.\nThis being my 6th year in the business of sustainable agriculture and following the success of numerous agricultural and agroforestry products, I am confident in my ability to serve this product to the local consumer base and beyond.  Please come and check us out via the provided links!",

WISE BLOOD, this original operatic composition and sculptural installation has the potential to bring together new audiences for creative endeavor across artistic disciplines - contemporary artists, sculptors, opera singers, brass musicians, rock 'n' rollers, writers and lovers of gothic Americana, into our uniquely preserved 130-year-old brick factory space in the heart of the city. The level and depth of this artistic collaboration is inherently new and risky. Bringing together our diverse artistic communities and organizations, we know that this is a risk worth taking, to test traditional artistic boundaries, and to engage, thrill and inspire new audiences in an unique immersive experience."

I didn\u2019t want tragedy, writer\u2019s block, being hit by an asteroid impact, madness, or corruption to interfere with the design. Since I'm here and giving you a chance to pre-order this sexy game, this means the game is written, tested, and ready to go into the final stages of production. These stages include editing, layout, art acquisition, printing, and shipping the printed products into distribution. Though I am using the very best people in the business and I am confident we'll sail through these stages laughing all the way, things happen. To mitigate the risks, I have backup people in place just in case an editor gets sucked into a black hole or an artist decides to change careers mid-way through the project.",

I will handle shipping the rulebooks to backers with the help of my dear friends and family. Digital products will be available as soon as they\u2019re done. And if we unlock additional print products via stretch goals, they\u2019ll be out as soon as we get them done. ",

Duck Creek Hospitality Group LLC has a strong background with over 20 years in the Food and Beverage Industry, combined with financial expertise, marketing and promotion and all the components necessary to make this project successful. While we are investing our own capital to fund most start-up activities, we want to secure additional funds to make the project very special - to be able to decorate the tavern and restaurant with historic items like antique signage, chandeliers, sconces, paintings, and to support the pre-marketing activities to make sure everyone from our neighbors in Smyrna, and from Wilmington to Ocean City to Washington DC are salivating for a taste of Inn at Duck Creek food and atmosphere, to gather with friends, and who are curious to sample our local beer wine and spirits in what will be a destination landmark restaurant.",

            "The risks for this campaign are pretty minimal. Unlike many other Kickstarter projects where you may end up waiting quite a while to get your rewards. The designs for the shirts are already complete. I have been designing and printing shirts for a number of years now, and already have accounts setup with reliable manufacturers and distributors. As soon as the campaign is funded and I know which items have been requested, I will order all of the necessary articles right away, which will arrive in less than a week. I will only be using suppliers that I have already been using for years now, and I already know exactly what specific styles and manufacturers of the selected apparel items that I will be using, all of which is based directly on items that I have already used and worn myself leading up now, and have had nothing but great personal experiences with. ", 
            "The biggest challenge after the undecorated items arrive in my possession, will be the fact that I'll be printing them all myself, and this will include extra amounts of overall labor, prep work and cleanup, because of the number of different designs and the fact that everyone will be able to customize the various styles with different colors and print locations. This is more of a workload challenge than a risk, because I already have all the necessary supplies and abilities to do the printing with, along with direct access to a local studio where I will be doing all of the printing at. All rewards will be shipped out by me within two months of the campaign ending, unless the demand from the campaign is higher than I can physically meet on my own, at which point I will also potentially employ the services of a high-quality, reputable local screen-printing studio to help out with the overall print-load. Any potential delays will be posted in the updates section right away, should they arise."

            "Why you should trust Flesk Publications? John answers:\n\"I pride myself on having a thirteen year record of delivering over sixty books of the highest quality. We have run four previous Kickstarter campaigns, one with Brom and Mark Schultz, both of which were delivered on time. Our third campaign was with Frank Cho and a fourth with Petar Meseldzija for his Book of Giants (at the printer now). We were two weeks late shipping the Cho books due to the books being stuck on the docks due to a California port crisis. Things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over sixty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would. Bottom line, I would not have been around this long without an excellent track record.\""

I've never been comfortable with this which is why we machine all of our goods manually.  I'm confident, however, in the shop we've chosen to do the work.  The quality is there but, more importantly, the work ethic is equal to ours.  Another challenge will be assembly.  Every base needs a press fit pin with roller bearings which requires a bit of accuracy and time for each.  This is just a matter of spending the time on each and ensuring the quality of the fit.  The final challenge is fulfillment...as always.  This is consistently underestimated by not only myself but other creators.  It's just difficult to predict but, this being my third campaign, I feel like I'm getting a solid grip on the process."

Maybe the manufacturer of the driver chips will suddenly stop making them and I\u2019ll have to redesign around an alternative.

However, with careful planning the tours upon which the NEYE has embarked with Preston Hawes as director have NOT run over budget and have always been fully funded before departure. This same care and attention is, out of necessity, being taken again. ", 
            "Carnegie Hall revenue has declined steadily since 2008 given the setbacks in the economy and we can no longer rely upon these events to fund the majority of our tours. Supporters from our alumni and friends are key. Developing a sense of ownership in support of this group from those who have enjoyed the music or experienced tours as members is now our most valuable resource. Maintaining close ties and developing renewed ties to those who find our mission important and valuable remains one of the most important tasks the Director has."

As factories within the UK are mainly CMT, I will ensure that I have all the components manufactured with enough time to then move to the factory. To minimise all risk of manufacturing setbacks, I have lined up at least one back-up manufacturer within the UK. I will be working alongside extremely experienced manufacturers whose businesses have been around for longer than I have been alive! This will hopefully mitigate a lot of risk surrounding the Neon Moon bra and knickers manufacturing.",

A full size chart (beyond the scope of UK 8-10, 10-12, 12-14) will be sent to all backers emails and uploaded on the website / social media before shipments are finalised in order to mitigate wrong sizing. All UK sizing will be as true to size as possible, with the expertise of the manufacturer.",

            "This Kickstarter Campaign has been created to generate funds to enable the creation of more of the glass floats to be hidden on the island, pay for operating expenses, purchase materials, and to ensure that this event becomes a yearly tradition on Block Island. Starting in late April/early May, we will begin creating the hundreds of glass floats needed to hide around the island. Making glass is an incredibly expensive venture and we need your help to get the ball rolling!! The funds we are seeking from this kickstarter campaign will go towards purchasing raw materials, paying for the propane and electricity that run our equipment, and other operating expenses that have to be paid to make all of this work. Without help from our kickstarter supporters, we will have to cut back on the number of floats that we would like to hide on the island next year... Less floats hidden obviously means that there will be less floats to be found!! One major change that is planned for 2015 is the hiding of smaller numbers of floats more frequently, so that the chances of finding them are spread out throughout the season. I really want YOU to find a float when YOU come to the island.. This will require more trips to the island, and more hikes around the island to hide them, but it will ensure that the odds of finding one will be better."

I've worked independently, I've worked for a mainstream publisher, and, as I'm doing here, I've managed projects as a gun-for-hire. I've definitely been around the block a few times and seen the extremes at both ends of the Kickstarter roller coaster. No matter how much experienced a project manager has, things can run smoothly, or they can hit bumps along the way. I can only make you one meaningful promise -- I will do my best to make it all go to plan and I will be honest and open throughout. Thank you for your support.",

            "3. We have done significant pre-production and have all the art for the  game completed and the graphic design is nearly complete. With our years of digital game development, we learned the value of pre-production work and know that it saves time and money at the end of the project. ", 
            "4. With the help of David, we have contacted several manufacturers to find us the best quality at the best price. We have the production quote ready and can initiate production in short order. ", 
            "5. We have done rigorous play-testing on Valeria: Card Kingdoms. Not only has it been continuously tested at Game Designers Clubhouse, but we have shipped prototypes all over the world.",

It\u2019s highly likely that things will not go as planned, but that\u2019s okay. Failure, problem- solving, flexibility, a sense of humor and initiative all are important in the education process, encouraging the growth of students and teacher. The difficulties we will encounter will be different for each part of our project. ", 
            "During our photography expedition, there are several things not in our control and our desert environment offers unique challenges. Inclement weather, low or high river levels, equipment accidents and adventurer accidents are just a few of the possibilities. Background knowledge and adaptability are our focus for this part of our project. We have been preparing for our trip, brainstorming, and making lists! We are being as informed as possible, discussing needed supplies and equipment, proper clothing, weather protection, and student concerns. We have chosen experience guides to help us along the way. ", 
            "The design and construction of our darkroom will hold its own challenges. As we near the end of the school year, it becomes hectic. In our small school, students and staff are involved in a multitude of activities and have numerous responsibilities. Our focus will be to plan and follow a tight, but realistic schedule to complete the darkroom. We also have the option of asking for help from our school community and parents. We have engaged in other large scale projects and feel we are prepared to meet the challenges of any obstacles that arise."

            "Step 1)  Editing. The editing required four passes, done off and on during the last four years. I had a lot of journal material to work with.  One issue was to edit this down to a publishable size.  Another task was to give each entry a rounded-off and standalone quality, making them like little stories or essays.", 
            "Step 2) Book design. This involved cleaning up and standardizing the formats of the component manuscripts.  I imported the final text document into InDesign desktop publishing software, experimenting with several possible layouts. I experimented with a two-volume layout, but I decided it would work better to have a single large book.  I went through several rounds of printing proofs. And I used the services of proofreaders to hunt down the typos.", 
            "Step 3) Cover design. I designed the cover art myself, using my oil painting based on a photograph of me diving in Jellyfish Lake in Palau.  To get a nice-looking final design, I got help from my daughter Georgia Rucker, who is a professional book designer.", 
            "Step 4) Production. I export my InDesign book files in the PDF format and send them to Amazon Create Space and to Ingram Lightning for producing paper-backs and hardbacks.  I can also export EPUB format ebooks from InDesign, and it's relatively easy to convert these to the Kindle-friendly MOBI format, using the Sigil and the Calibre software for this task.", 
            "Step 5) Distribution. I sell the ebooks via Amazon and my own Transreal Books site, sometimes using other ebook sites a well.. I sell the paperbacks and hardbacks via Amazon and Barnes & Noble, and I distribute the paperbacks and hardbacks to retail stores via Amazon and/or via Lightning.", 
            "I've published several Transreal Books titles by now, and I'm confident that I can take my JOURNALS through the necessary steps."

            "As with any piece of original devised theatre, the end product is never fully realised until opening night. This, however, is the thrill of new devised work. 'Shooting with Light' will be our 6th production to date and we have successfully worked together over 10 years, problem solving all manner of issues running a theatre company brings. We have taken it all in our stride and wholly believe in our abilities and in Idle Motion more than ever. We have been working on the Research and Development of 'Shooting with Light' since 2014, when we scratched our work at New Diorama, to great critical success. This enabled us to work out the story, methods of storytelling, visuals and music. We are now building on this and will finish creating a truly exceptional and original piece of theatre."

In response to this, we have assembled a planning team that has met regularly since the start of the school year and will continue to do so.
