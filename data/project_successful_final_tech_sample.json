Your support will help balance our budget and will provide the required match to the MRAC funds. ",

This distance has given us an opportunity to experiment with our collaborative process, and we've continued our weekly rehearsals over skype, met up in L.A. for a mid-winter retreat, and learned a little more about film as a medium for dance. ",

Theresa has already begun the logistical work and, as she is handily located in Minneapolis, is the point person for all things local. We've already recruited a number of stunning dancers (to be revealed to backers during this campaign!), are working with the incomparable Heidi Eckwall as our lighting designer, and have the wonderful Aaron Schoenrock on board to wrangle all things stage-managerial.

See as how we plan to have the project finished by then, the loss of the development tools is only a possibility (and an extremely small one at that).

            "Inclusive Arts Vibe Dance Company has been rehearsing for our spring performance for over a year.  We are learning the last bit of choreography and polishing our dances.  We have secured funding from the Regional Art and Culture Council,  Oregon Community Foundation, Northwest Health Foundation and Oregon Jewish Community Youth Foundation.  Our show will go on even if we don't accomplish our Kickstarter.  However, it will mean a big difference for us. We will not be able to get all the costumes we need, we will not be able to hire a professional videographer nor a photographer to document our performance.  We also need funding to hire ASL interpreters and an Audio Describer to make our performance accessible for everyone!"

            "- LOCATION: The largest chunk of the budget will go towards paying for a location. The story takes place in a specific business located in an ethnic neighborhood. The character Sheila is forced to ask for help in a public place. We are looking to pay business owners, who will have to close their store for two days for us to shoot in their shops. We also have to pay someone from the store to supervise on set due to production safety requirements. ", 
            "- ART DIRECTION: To elevate the film\u2019s look, the location has an old-school aesthetic design to it. The shop is owned by a Russian immigrant. We will be buying and making Russian language posters for the store and its bathroom. Other props and costumes we will need include pastries to fill the shop, kitchen utensils, aprons, and black work pants. A visual motif in the story is the color red. So we will be buying red props such as red napkins and flowers. Because the story revolves around Sheila\u2019s stained shorts, my art team will buy several pairs of white shorts to test out the bloodstain. We will need to buy red dye and fake blood.  ", 
            "- TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT: Due to the large amount of camera equipment, lighting rigs, tripods, and electrical gear, we will rent a U-Haul truck for two full days to transport the equipment to set. We will be hiring drivers and renting a passenger van to drive the cast and crew to the location set as well.  ", 
            "- CAMERA EQUIPMENT: To achieve the desired comedy look, we will be renting a zoom lens, filters, and follow focus. Other smaller accessories include extra batteries, lighting meter, and disk drives.  ", 
            "- FOOD: Buying three full days of meals during the film shoot for all fifteen members of my cast and crew. My actors and crew members are all working for free on the project. The least I can do is offer them healthy meals, not carb loaded fast food, to stay energized on set.  ", 
            "Thank you for taking the time to read about this project. I am grateful for all the hardworking and passionate people who are supporting this movie. We would greatly appreciate any of your help! You are all helping to make this project become the best film that it can be! ",

I want to exceed expectations on this front once again like we did on our first three Kickstarter projects. So to once again help support this goal, we have already completed sculpting and initial master molding on the core set of miniatures. We have also performed test castings to ensure everything is dialed in from a pewter quality perspective. We have already had our pewter miniature caster set aside casting time and packing time so we can quickly get a head start on production as this campaign is underway. Just like with our first three Kickstarter projects, we will keep our backers in the loop with frequent updates throughout the run of this new Kickstarter project. All of our production and packing/shipping will take place in/from the Midwest USA.",

International shipping is expensive and this large release will be no exception.

            "Alla inblandade kommer att g\u00e5 in f\u00f6r att arbeta ideellt med detta projekt. Att arbeta ideellt i en ensemble kr\u00e4ver mycket t\u00e5lamod och h\u00e4ngivenhet. Kanske vill ingen se en pj\u00e4s om kvinnor som utsatts f\u00f6r v\u00e5ldt\u00e4kt. Kanske vill ingen st\u00f6tta projektet. Projektet kommer att bli av men i vilken utstr\u00e4ckning och till vilkas f\u00f6rm\u00e5n beror p\u00e5 publik, \"backare\" och hur id\u00e9n tas emot i samh\u00e4llet.", 
            " Den f\u00e4rdiga f\u00f6rest\u00e4llningen kommer troligtvis att provocera och v\u00e4cka obehagliga k\u00e4nslor. F\u00f6rest\u00e4llningen kommer att behandla \u00e4mnen som rubbad sexualitet, fysiskt v\u00e5ld, sj\u00e4lvskadebeteende, kvinnohat, \"manshat\", sj\u00e4lvk\u00e4nsla, \u00e5ngest, depression, psykiskt v\u00e5ld, diskriminering, sexism, k\u00e4nslonormer, f\u00f6rnekelse, f\u00f6rdomar. Jag vill med projektet skapa ett tidl\u00f6st teaterstycke med h\u00f6g identifieringsfaktor med m\u00e4nskligheten som m\u00e5lgrupp. Projektet v\u00e4nder sig till alla \u00e5ldrar och kommer att fungera i utbildande syfte f\u00f6r h\u00f6gstadie- och gymnasieklasser samt arbetskollegier."

But at the same time, overcoming those challenges is one of the most satisfying rewards life has to offer, which is why the film will most certainly get made if this Kickstarter is successful!",

What this means is that although we are listing December as our expected release, it could possibly (though very unlikely) stretch into 2016. If it does however, I will keep you constantly updated, sweeten you up with some bonus rewards, and make sure the film is completely worth it when ready.",

The two things that could keep from delivering a book like this are creative problems and logistical problems. We have both those issues covered.", 
            "1. Creative issues. The story and art are well underway. The major content questions are settled, printers have been sourced and we\u2019re in contact with professionals for editing and constructive feedback along the way. All that remains is completion of art and story, editing, putting the book together and printing. \n2. Logistical issues. Together with my wife and business partner Jennifer, we have over 54 years of combined experience in creating and implementing hundreds of creative projects for our commercial clients at Brickhouse Studios Inc, many much larger and more complex than this book project. We have outlined the project so that it\u2019s fully manageable with no major unknowns. There are always surprises, but we\u2019ve built flex-time into our schedule so that we don\u2019t promise more than we can deliver. ", 
            "We\u2019re professionals so we will stick with it even if the going gets rough. All-in-all, we are very confident that we can get the book printed and into the hands of our supporters in a timely manner, and at a quality level that we ourselves would expect for a beautiful, professional children\u2019s book.\nThank you for your support!\nJohn Churchman"
