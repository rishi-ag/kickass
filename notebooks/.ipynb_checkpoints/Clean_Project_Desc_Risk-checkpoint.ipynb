Long story short...2012, I had my first artist alley booth and once the day came...nothing I thought I was prepared for actually happened. The attendees, the other artists, and the part that I was still feeling that exposing my art to \"the world\" was a feeling like I was standing on stage...naked.\\n\\n\\nArt is War Tank Top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCensored Beauties\\n\\n\\nAfter that weekend, I knew I had to work harder on:\\nbeing able to talk about my work\\nhaving a variety (there happened to be a scout there)\\nthe fear of what people thought\\n\\n\\n\\nZombie Flower Girl - canvas painting; acrylic\\n\\n\\nI now feel like I am ready and ready to take it head on. A bit nervous at the thought, but I have been feeling quite comfortable with sharing my works and works in progress on instagram. Which is awesome! I have had several questions about the skills I use to create my art, the tools I use, and even the paint I use! I love teaching others so they can improve as well. :) I already have a table purchased for Ninja-Con (June 6th) and one for Touhou Con (September 18-20) of this year of course. There might be another one in December, but once their location has been confirmed, I will be there! :D\\n\\n\\nReign of Flowers (pieces 1-9)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReign of Flowers (pieces 10-19)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReign of Flowers (last 3 pieces)\\n\\n\\nThis project is just to feed the passion and hunger I have to draw and having the funds to be part of more convention\\'s artist alleys to present my artwork to the world. The smile and happiness that people show when seeing my art work is worth a millions of dollars. Yes, I am saying that if I could I would draw for free. But sadly this world does not work that way. I slave away at a 8-5 day job, daydreaming of my next projects...lol The rewards are the gift I can give to you for helping me on my journey to share my world & mind, one drawing at a time. Plus, especially if you cannot support me in person by attending a convention, its a way to help. Thank you for your help, its greatly appreciated more than you can ever imagine! :D\\n\\n\\nArt is War - Sticker\\n\\n\\nXOXO,amandarias\\n',\n",

       "' The 10 different designs Rewards #1 & #5 & #7 are the bottom 3 pieces - Flaw of Eden Hello everyone!I am Amanda Arias (amandarias). Long story short...2012, I had my first artist alley booth and once the day came...nothing I thought I was prepared for actually happened. The attendees, the other artists, and the part that I was still feeling that exposing my art to \"the world\" was a feeling like I was standing on stage...naked. Art is War Tank Top Censored Beauties After that weekend, I knew I had to work harder on: being able to talk about my work having a variety (there happened to be a scout there) the fear of what people thought Zombie Flower Girl - canvas painting; acrylic I now feel like I am ready and ready to take it head on. A bit nervous at the thought, but I have been feeling quite comfortable with sharing my works and works in progress on instagram. Which is awesome! I have had several questions about the skills I use to create my art, the tools I use, and even the paint I use! I love teaching others so they can improve as well. :) I already have a table purchased for Ninja-Con (June 6th) and one for Touhou Con (September 18-20) of this year of course. There might be another one in December, but once their location has been confirmed, I will be there! :D Reign of Flowers (pieces 1-9) Reign of Flowers (pieces 10-19) Reign of Flowers (last 3 pieces) This project is just to feed the passion and hunger I have to draw and having the funds to be part of more convention\\'s artist alleys to present my artwork to the world. The smile and happiness that people show when seeing my art work is worth a millions of dollars. Yes, I am saying that if I could I would draw for free. But sadly this world does not work that way. I slave away at a 8-5 day job, daydreaming of my next projects...lol The rewards are the gift I can give to you for helping me on my journey to share my world & mind, one drawing at a time. Plus, especially if you cannot support me in person by attending a convention, its a way to help. Thank you for your help, its greatly appreciated more than you can ever imagine! :D Art is War - Sticker XOXO,amandarias '"
