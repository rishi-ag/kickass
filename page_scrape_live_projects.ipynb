        "[<p><b>Thank you for helping us hit 100% in 16 days!</b><br/>Our funding goal was the bare minimum we needed to install ENVELOP. Together we made this happen!<br/><br/><b>Now we must hit our stretch goals to take this project to the next level! </b><br/>See below for the budget of our new goals, and how you contribution matters. Many of our best rewards still remain!\u00a0</p>,\n",
        " <p>For over 50 years we have been listening to music in stereo (two speakers), but we hear in 3 dimensions. Our natural mechanism for listening is designed to perceive sounds coming from all around us: however, our ability to experience music has been limited by the geometry of stereo for decades. We believe the time is ripe for that to change.\u00a0</p>,\n",
        " <p>ENVELOP is a 3D sound platform that introduces an open source software toolkit and educational initiatives to help any artist align their creativity with new technologies for creating music in three dimensions.</p>,\n",
        " <p>We are creating a next-generation 28.4 speaker audiovisual system that features innovative technology to move sound in space around the audience from any direction. ENVELOP is new environment for artists to create and perform music in 3D surround sound.</p>,\n",
        " <p>We have already received generous donations to pay for the ENVELOP system equipment, and have secured a 3 year lease in a prime location. We have a small gap in the funding needed to make this project come to life and need the community's support to fund the final build out. \u00a0</p>,\n",
        " <p>Together we can influence the future of music and make it a 3D experience.</p>,\n",
        " <p>\u00a0ENVELOP will be used in the following ways:</p>,\n",
        " <p>The ENVELOP 28.4 channel sound system can produce sounds coming from above, below, in front of, behind, and completely around an audience. A high-fidelity video projection system and LED lights embedded within the ENVELOP columns can be controlled in unison with audio to build synchronized audio/visual compositions.</p>,\n",
        " <p>The ENVELOP system will be built in a dedicated space within The Midway, a new massive and diverse arts and entertainment complex opening this summer in the rapidly up-and-coming Dogpatch district of San Francisco. The Midway is planned to include a large-scale night club, cafe/lounge, artist studios, art galleries, a teaching kitchen, and offices for local non-profits. Our physical home within the Midway creative complex connects ENVELOP with a diverse audience and to creators in many different domains.</p>,\n",
        " <p>So what actually does \u201cimmersive audio\u201d or \u201c3D sound\u201d actually mean? It\u2019s a new concept for a lot of people.  Think of it this way; what if music was composed to move around you from all directions, not just from in front of you?</p>,\n",
        " <p>For over 50 years the music industry has been firmly rooted in stereo sound.  Naturally occurring sound on the other hand comes at us from all angles, not just the direction we are facing.  Yet the music we all listen to is still created using a technology that does not allow sound to move around us from every angle.  </p>,\n",
        " <p>It is no mystery that sound and music has the power to influence our emotions, psychological state and physical sensations.\u00a0<i>3D-immersive audio literally puts you inside the music.</i>  It can can foster a more intimate connection with sound, and deepen the way we listen.</p>,\n",
        " <p>We believe that new ways of listening will encourage new ways of creating and thinking about music production, and with shifts in listening come shifts in consciousness.</p>,\n",
        " <p>The foundation of ENVELOP\u2019s technology is Ambisonics, a proven open source sound mapping technology that has flourished in academic settings (such as Stanford\u2019s CCRMA).  Envelop will bring this technology out of academia and to the general public as a permanent installation for the first time in the Bay Area.</p>,\n",
        " <p>With Ambisonics, artists determine a virtual location in space where they want to place a sound source, and the source is then rendered within a spherical array of speakers. Ambisonics is a coordinate based mapping system; rather than positioning sounds to different locations around the room based on speaker locations (as with conventional surround sound techniques), sounds are digitally mapped to different locations using x,y,z coordinates. All the speakers then work simultaneously to position and move sound around the listener from any direction - above, below, and even between speakers.  </p>,\n",

        " <p>ENVELOP is building a suite of open source tools for artists to control sound in three dimensions. These tools integrate seamlessly into artists' existing workflow with a very gentle learning curve.  A musician will be able to determine where sound elements within their mix are positioned around the room, as easily as tempo or pitch are controlled.  Creative coders may contribute their own code for synthesis, effects, controllers, and content so that the ENVELOP instrument will become richer and more powerful over time.

        " <p>Generous private donations have helped us acquire the core technology needed for the ENVELOP system in San Francisco, but we still need to pay for the installation and integration of this technology; the construction of a main console, an acoustic treatment of the space, and the 8 massive columns that hold the speakers.
